sse_example works in a way in which when one api is called (in this case placing order),
will trigger data to be sent to other listeners(in this case the admin listeners).

>>
Do you know we can even do an audio call!
Yes, I do. We have cell phones.
i mean on vscode :-)
Ohh. i didn't know that

>>
any tasks for me
you need to implement acceptorder api
after that you should do ordering of food api, i will write the definition shortly.
ok

>>
in add_items, will conn.execute insert only one value ?
Yes
should we implement another api for contains table
no need, but function can be implemented which can be called by add_combos
ok

joined again
Cool

>>
ok i will check the sse once more
Tomorrow we will meet at 8:15 right
Yes

>>
for sse part i am thinking of implementing this way
we would have a global dict of { [admin_id]: [mutex_lock,order_information]}

once the order is placed , we will just go to that location on the dict ,put the order information ,
 and then release the mutex lock.
 admin will read the order lock it again and wait for the lock to be released.

Thats all
Ok. But you only should implement, no problem
I will implement whatever i can
ok
Good Night.
